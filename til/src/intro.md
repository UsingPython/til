# Today I Learned

This mdBook is a personal collection of more or less useful little things that I have learned from day to day. It is **not** a blog.

The contributions should all be relatively short and reduced to the essentials. It is also a tool to consolidate new knowledge and a quick reference point at the same time.

The project is inspired by [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til). Thanks a lot for the amazing work! ([How I Built a Learning Machine ](https://dev.to/jbranchaud/how-i-built-a-learning-machine-45k9))
